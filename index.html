<p style="text-align: center;">*disclaimer im going to give advice of things i actually dont do cause im a lazy tard but here we go</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">first of all we need to start with what habits are. &nbsp;
<br /><br /><strong><em>habit /ˈhabɪt/ : a behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance</em></em><br /><br />
i do believe that life gravitates around the habits that we have formed. i have made good habit of sayin cunt to literally everyone and is working extremely well jk. habits play role in:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>- &nbsp; how happy or unhappy u are.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>- &nbsp; how commited or not u are to things u want to achieve.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>- &nbsp; how succesfull or unsucessfull u are./strong></em></p>
