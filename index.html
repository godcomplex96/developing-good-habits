   <h2>how good habits can severely increase your performance</h2>


  first of all we need to start with what habits are. 
  <q>habit /ˈhabɪt/ : a behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance</q>
  
  i do believe that life gravitates around the habits that we have formed.
  
  how happy or unhappy u are.
  how commited or not u are to things u want to achieve.
  how succesfull or unsucessfull u are
  
  all the decisions we did and make in life gravitate around the habits we have formed.
  
  good thing is that if we arent satisfied with the ones we have we can shape them.
