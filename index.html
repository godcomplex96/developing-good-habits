<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>developing good habits</strong></h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">how good habits can severely increase your performance</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*disclaimer im goin to give advice of things i actually dont do because lately ive been extremely lazy but here we go*</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">first of all we need to start with what habits are.<br><br><strong><em>habit /ˈhabɪt/ : a behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance</em></strong><br><br>i do believe that life gravitates around the habits that we have formed. i have made good habit of sayin cunt to literally everyone and is working extremely well jk. habits play role in:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>-&nbsp;how happy or unhappy u are.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>-&nbsp;how commited or not u are to things u want to achieve.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>-&nbsp;how succesfull or unsucessfull u are</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">all the decisions we did and make in life gravitate around the habits we have formed.<br><br>good thing is that if we arent satisfied with the ones we have we can shape them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***<br><br><br><strong>the science behind</strong><br><br><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D-Epn8U6zNc/XEvJFAt-KUI/AAAAAAAAg5o/s7wLyKHfoQ8r9LnI54tSHyB0Vrjc-fBfACLcBGAs/s640/habit-loop.png" alt=""></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">i dont want to make extremely long so im gonna do a tldr of how this works</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">- cue triggers brain to initiate a behavior. our mind is continuously searching our internal and external environment to find potential rewards</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">- second is craving, they are the fuel behind every habit. if we dont have at least a minimal motivation or desire we have no reason at all to act. its not like we crave the habit itself but change in state that delivers. ie. u dont crave watching porn, u crave the feeling of relief it provides.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">- third is response. the response is the actual habit you perform, it can b either as a form of a thought or an action. this really depends on how motivated u are. if the action requires more effort than u are willing to expend then u just simply wont do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">- and the last one is the reward. rewards are d end goal of every habit. simple cycle. cue is noticing the reward, craving is wanting the reward, response is about obtaining the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">we can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. the problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. the solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">all behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/start-small.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">and since we talk a lot about compounding gains in crypto we can talk about compounding habits too</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tiny-gains.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">so now that we know how habits work im gonna talk from personal experience and empirical evidence the ones that i do think that works the best to improve performance:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>-&nbsp;exercise</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>-&nbsp;nutrition</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&nbsp; - meditation</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">they all have something in common: @Bolic does none. jk they contribute to release key chemical brains that might improve or not how we feel so lets dismantle one by one in a tldr.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>dopamine:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">dopamine&nbsp;is a type of neurotransmitter. your&nbsp;nervous system&nbsp;uses it to send messages between nerve cells. thats why its sometimes called a chemical messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. its a big part of our unique human ability to think and plan. it helps us strive, focus, and find things interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">it plays major role on: learning, motivation, heart rate, blood vessel function, sleep, mood, attention, pain processing, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>cortisol:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">think of cortisol&nbsp;as natures built-in alarm system. its your body main stress&nbsp;hormone. it works with certain parts of your&nbsp;brain&nbsp;to control your mood, motivation, and fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">plays major role on: usage of nutrients, blood pressure, regulation of sleep/wake cycle, energy and stress handling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">your&nbsp;hypothalamus&nbsp;and pituitary gland, both located in your brain&nbsp;can sense if your blood&nbsp;contains the right level of cortisol. if the level is too low, your brain&nbsp;adjusts the amount of hormones it makes. your adrenal glands pick up on these signals and release accordingly</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">so what happens if we are in constant stress?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">it will lead to health problems such as:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">anxiety and depression, headaches, memory and concentration problems, trouble sleeping, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>serotonin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">serotonin is a chemical nerve cells produce. it sends signals between your nerve cells.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">serotonin impacts every part of your body, from your emotions to your motor skills. its considered a natural mood stabilizer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">when its on its normal levels serotonin helps to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">feel happier, calmer, more focused, less anxious, more emotionally stable, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">now that we know the main chemical brains that we are trying to focus on lets jump in how we can regulate them to have a healthier mentality</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>exercise:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">y. this is boss flexin</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xmCuyPX.png" alt=""></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">he forced me to post it</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">aerobic exercise is known to activate the body stress response, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, hence why many people engage in sports like running because they perceive its effects as relaxing. solving this apparent contradiction calls for a distinction between &ldquo;good stress&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad stress,&rdquo; or physical and psychological stress respectively (for ease of discussion), which in turn requires a deeper analysis of the neural mechanisms underlying both stress and aerobic exercise.&nbsp;studies have shown the potential for exercise to alleviate depression and anxiety,&nbsp;both acute and chronic exercise may even lead to improved cognitive performance, whereas psychological stress is known to impair cognitive functions</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">all in all, it seems that what makes exercise-induced stress different from stress due to negative life events is that, in contrast to psychological (bad) stress, physical (good) stress is associated with increased inactivation of cortisol (active steroid) into cortisone (inert steroid), increased level of AEA, BDNF, and serotonin. in particular, it seems that aerobic exercise modulates hormone, neurotrophin and neurotransmitter levels</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">the study which appeared in the peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet Psychiatry, examined survey results from 2011, 2013 and 2015. researchers found that, on average, a person has 3.4 poor mental health days per month.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">but among those who exercise, the number of poor mental health days dropped by more than 40 percent. exercise may change the way the brain functions, which could account for the decrease in depression or anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">***</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="s1">nutrition:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">good ol times when btc wasnt at 5k. sry at 30k.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="s1"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748597607311343637/842187985365630987/HcQGecS3.png" alt=""></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">one of the most obvious yet under recognised factors in the development of mental health is nutrition. just like the heart, stomach and liver, the brain is an organ that requires different amounts of complex carbohydrates,<br>essential fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and water to remain healthy. an integrated approach that equally reflects the interplay of biological factors, as well as broader psychological, emotional and social conceptions of mental health,<br>is vital in order to reduce the prevalence and the distress caused by mental health problems: diet is a cornerstone of this integrated approach.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">its also extremely important to know that 95% of our serotonin is produced in our gastrointestinal tract so it doesnt only help you digest food but also play key role in your emotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">studies have compared &quot;traditional&quot; diets, like the&nbsp;meditarranean diet&nbsp;and the traditional japanese diet, to a typical &quot;western&quot; diet and have shown that the risk of depression is 25% to 35% lower in those who eat a traditional diet. scientists account for this difference because these traditional diets tend to be high in vegetables, fruits, unprocessed grains, and fish and seafood, and to contain only modest amounts of lean meats and dairy. they are also void of processed and refined foods and sugars.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">table of nutrients and their effect of deficiency</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">&nbsp;<img src="https://gyazo.com/60832514e19befd31728f7f422989403.png"><br><br></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">and last one. y ik that most of u cunts didnt make it to this point but still.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">last one is:</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;meditation</strong></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">the practice appears to have an amazing variety of neurological benefits &ndash; from changes in&nbsp;grey matter volume to reduced activity in the &ldquo;me&rdquo; centers of the brain to enhanced connectivity between brain regions.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">meditation helps relieve our subjective levels of anxiety and depression, and improve attention, concentration, and overall psychological well-being.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">mindfulness meditation decreases activity in the default mode network (DMN), the brain network&nbsp;responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thoughts a.k.a d &ldquo;monkey mind.&rdquo;. since mind-wandering is typically&nbsp;associated with being less happy&nbsp;ruminating, and worrying about the past and future, its the goal for many people to dial it down.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">A review&nbsp;study&nbsp;last year at Johns Hopkins looked at the relationship between mindfulness meditation and its ability to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pain. researcher Madhav Goyal and his team found that the effect size of meditation was moderate, at 0.3. if this sounds low, keep in mind that the effect size for antidepressants is also 0.3, which makes the effect of meditation sound pretty good.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">mindfulness meditation can actually change the structure of the brain: eight weeks of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was found to increase cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which governs learning and memory, and in certain areas of the brain that play roles in emotion regulation and self-referential processing. there were also <em>decreases</em> in brain cell volume in the amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety, and stress &ndash; and these changes matched the participants self-reports of their stress levels, indicating that meditation not only changes the brain, but it changes our subjective perception and feelings as well.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">so y. in my opinion for skeptical ppl is at least worth a try.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">i think its already long enough and dont want to overwhelm ppl with study researchs so we cuttin off here. hope u enjoyed it.</p>
