  <h2>how good habits can severely increase your performance</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
  first of all we need to start with what habits are. 
&nbsp;
  <q>habit /ˈhabɪt/ : a behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance</q>
&nbsp;
  
  i do believe that life gravitates around the habits that we have formed.
&nbsp;
  
  how happy or unhappy u are.
&nbsp;
  how commited or not u are to things u want to achieve.
&nbsp;
  how succesfull or unsucessfull u are
&nbsp;
  
  all the decisions we did and make in life gravitate around the habits we have formed.
&nbsp;
  
  good thing is that if we arent satisfied with the ones we have we can shape them.
